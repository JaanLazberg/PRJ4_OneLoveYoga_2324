        <h1>Production</h1>
        <h2>1. Color Palette</h2><p>
The chosen colors are reference to the 5 elements found within Ayurveda, the sister since to Yoga. 
The Ochre represents the warm glow of a hearty fire (Vayu), the blue represents deep, cool water (Jal). Brown, a deep, soillike color represents our fertileEarth (Prithvi) while the lighter beige represents the sky just before dawn breaks, Air (Vayu) . Space, (Akasha) is represented as white as it is all around us and infinite. 

Color is a vital tool for communicating a message and says everything about the one sending it. We chose these colors in accordance with Ayurveda to match the harmonious balance of all five elements with our company. </p>
<h2>2. Logo</h2> 
<p>The Logo has been designed to be especially peaceful and welcoming. People who practice Yoga should feel warm and in balance, something the Yin-Yang refers to. The stairs the Brand-name sits upon are a reference to temples and tranquil places to meditate.</p>
 <h2>3. Typography</h2>
<p>Our Chosen fonts are Lobster and Montserrat.
Lobster is a playful, yet extremely welcoming font that feels flexible and bends itself in many ways, reminding one of the many ways Yoga can be practiced and perhaps also inspiring the reader to try out a new yoga-pose. 
Montserrat is the opposite, it is clean and no-nonsense. This was done on purpose to not only create balance and harmony, but also to make sure the way we communicate remains light without losing sight of our values when communicating our messages. 
Both are modern fonts designed for interacting with a modern world while also leveraging that careful balance between approachability, seriousness and playfulness.</p>

        <h1>Marketing</h1>
        <p>Starting with the "problem" of our target audience, who is yoga lovers. Yoga lovers have a lack of flexibility within their schedules. They would like to follow a yoga class but cannot fit this in their schedule, so they decide to practice yoga at home. This information came from the interview we did with 4 people from our target group.</p>

        <h1>Who is our target audience?</h1>

        <h1>Communication (objectives)</h1>
        	<p>We will use Instagram and TikTok to communicate to our audience. On YouTube yoga lovers look for educational content surrounding yoga. We also found oud that Instagram and TikTok are the most used social media platforms by Gen-Z so will be communicating through that as well. However, because two of our peers quit the study near the end of this project, we decided to fully commit to Instagram. We decided it was best to focus on quanity instead of quality. This way we got more data to reflect on. We ditched our communication schedule and started posting almost every day. Because the hectic workload form this project we could not post every day.</p>
		  
		  <h1>Objective:</h1>

        	<p>In the whole world <a href="https://yogaearth.com/yoga-research/yoga-statistics/">approximately 300 million people actively do yoga.</a></p>  

       		<p>Considering the population of 8 billion people the percentage of yogis is 3.75%.</p> 

        	<p>The population of Noord-Brabant is <a href="https://www.citypopulation.de/en/netherlands/admin/NL41__noord_brabant/">2644872 people</a></p>

       		<p>Taking the information above of 3.75% of yogis and Noord-Brabant population, we can calculate that around 100.000 people do yoga. With our campaign we want to reach 5% percent, which means that our reach objective is 5000 yogis.</p>

        <h1>Instagram</h1>
        <p>This is our Instagram page. We managed to post 8 times. We are not super happy with this. We wanted to post at lest 10 times to have a good amount of data. Reflecting on this, we should have posten two times a day instead of one. This way you can also compare the results of time of day which can be usefull. However, 8 is still a useable amount. Because of bad communication there are some style breaks. You can clearly see in the image that three posts are not in the same style as the rest. In the future there should only be one person that handles the social media. This way we can filter out these mistakes.</p>

        <h1>Lean Canvas Appendix</h1>
        	<p>PROBLEM -– many of the interviewees mentioned that it is especially important for them to keep the work/life balance and it can be hard to incorporate yoga sessions into their daily routine. In order for people to find time for their yoga sessions they usually give up on real life classes since it can be too far from them or it doesn`t fit their schedule</p>

			<p>SOLUTION -– the solution comes in creating an analog of real-life yoga community, but in virtual space. Everything which would usually come along with yoga classes – friends, trainer, pieces of advice from other yogis – we incorporate it online and try to make it as real as possible by engaging our community in social media, creating topics to discuss and online classes where people have their cameras on (optional)</p>

		  	<p>KEY METRICS – for the people at online classes we will measure 1.Monthly Active Users – number of people who subscribed to online classes 2. Conversion rate – monitoring the number of users who subscribe to classes after visiting the platform and checking what areas need to be improved. 3.Retention rate – measuring the percentage of users that continue to attend classes over time.   For the Instagram we will measure user growth rate, number of comments and likes under the post.</p> 

			<p>UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION – virtual community means that people have peer-to-peer support in their yoga journey while being at home, which is provided by our forums, social media and in-class interactions among members. Moreover, based on the personal skills, goals and preferences of yogi they get recommendations and suggestions which is based on their feedback.</p>

		  	<p>UNFAIR ADVANTAGE – our yoga community doesn`t require real-life presence which saves a lot of time for the users, while the online presence gives insights into their habits and preferences, which allows to give them personal offers</p>

		  	<p>CHANNELS – Website was chosen as a platform for tutorials and additional information since the posts can be attached to a specific place and given link to, while Instagram was chosen as community building tool since it has options of commenting and adding stories to your feed</p>

		  	<p>CUSTOMER SEGMENTS – we chose segment of experienced yoga lovers since in order to build a community we want to have people who are already motivated and want to take next step in their journey. Fluent English speakers target audience will allow to widen our number of customers and not limit on one region</p>

		  	<p>COST STRUCTURE – website requires hosting, which is a fixed cost per month and customer support receives wage per month despite of number of cases. yoga trainers give their classes according to the number of people that want to attend it, which makes it a variable.
			REVENUE STREAMS – paid subscription is going to be the easiest way to monitor the inflow and outflow of users, which gives us overview of the tendency</p>
